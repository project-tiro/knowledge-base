    "summary": "The Compactness Theorem for first-order logic states that for any set of sentences S, if every finite subset of S has a model, then S has a model. This theorem can be used to show that certain sets of structures are not definable in first-order logic; examples include connected graphs and finite sets of unbounded size. It also enables the nonstandard analysis, where the real number line is extended to include infinitesimals.\n",
