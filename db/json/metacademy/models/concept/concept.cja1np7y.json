    "summary": "Pointers are a data type in C which refer to a location in memory. They are used to build most of the fundamental data structures in C. Pointers are worth understanding even if you're programming in a language other than C, because it gives a language for talking about memory. This is important if you want to understand what's going on beneath the hood in higher level languages.\n",
