    "summary": "The determinant is a scalar value associated with a square matrix. It is convenient algebraically because it behaves nicely with respect to matrix multiplication, inverses, and transposes, as well as the Gaussian elimination operations. It gives the factor by which volumes are rescaled by the matrix's associated linear transformation. It also equals the product of the eigenvalues.\n",
