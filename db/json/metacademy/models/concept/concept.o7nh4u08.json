    "summary": "Newton's method is an optimization algorithm which, in the convex setting, iteratively minimizes quadratic approximations to the objective function. It can be impractical for high-dimensional problems because it requires inverting the Hessian matrix, but many highly effective optimization algorithms can be viewed as approximations to Newton's method.\n",
