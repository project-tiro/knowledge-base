    "summary": "A manifold is a space that locally resembles Euclidean space. It generalizes the notion of a surface: is is more general in the sense that a manifold need not be embedded in some higher dimensional Euclidean space. A differentiable (or smooth) manifold is a manifold equipped with a differential (or smooth) structure, which allows us to define notions such as differentiable functions, derivatives, and integrals. It is the basic object of study in differential geometry.\n\n",
