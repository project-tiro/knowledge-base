    "summary": "The sum-product and max-product algorithms give exact answers for tree graphical models, but if we apply the same update rules on a general graph, it often gives pretty reasonable results. This is known as loopy belief propagation, and it is a widely used approximate inference algorithm in coding theory and low level vision.\n",
