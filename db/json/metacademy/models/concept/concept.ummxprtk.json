    "summary": "Convex optimization refers to optimizing a convex function over a convex set. It is a very broad class of problems, encompassing widely used techniques such as linear programming, linear least squares, quadratic programming, and semidefinite programming. Convex optimization is important because for reasonable-sized problems, there are efficient algorithms for finding the global optimum.\n",
