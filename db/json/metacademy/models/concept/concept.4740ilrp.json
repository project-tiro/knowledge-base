    "summary": "The conjugate gradient algorithm typically isn't run to completion, but is more commonly stopped after a small number of iterations to obtain an approximate solution. If the eigenspectrum of A satisfies certain properties, one can show that CG can find a good approximate solution quickly.\n",
