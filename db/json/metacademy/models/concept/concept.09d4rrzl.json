    "summary": "Context-free grammars are a formalism for defining the syntax of formal languages. Strings are generated by applying a sequence of productions, each of which replaces a nonterminal symbol with a sequence of terminals and nonterminals. They are widely used in the implementation of programming languages and in modeling the syntax of natural languages.\n",
