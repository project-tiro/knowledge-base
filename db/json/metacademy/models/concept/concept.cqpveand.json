    "summary": "Uninformed search refers to a class of highly generic search strategies which use no problem-specific structure (other than the ability to generate successor states and evaluate costs and goal conditions). Examples include depth-first, breadth-first, and uniform cost search. These algorithms aren't very effective for complex tasks, but they're good enough for some small problems. \n",
