    "summary": "A* search is a search algorithm which makes use of a heuristic which estimates the distance from a node to a goal state. It iteratively expands nodes in order by their path cost plus their heuristic value. If the heuristic satisfies certain \"admissibility\" conditions, then A* is guaranteed to find an optimal path.\n",
