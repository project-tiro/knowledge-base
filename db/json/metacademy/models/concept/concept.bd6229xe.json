    "summary": "Probabilistic principal component analysis (PCA) is a formulation of PCA as a latent variable model. Each data point is assumed to be generated as a linear function of Gaussian latent variables, plus noise. Like PCA, it has a closed form solution in terms of the truncated SVD of the covariance matrix.\n",
