    "summary": "Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic mixture of mixtures (or admixture) model for grouped data. It is most commonly used as a topic model, where the observed data is the words and the groups are the individual documents. In the LDA topic model, the observed data (words) within the groups (documents) are the result of probabilistically choosing words from a specific topic (multinomial over the vocabulary), where the topic is itself drawn from a document-specific multinomial that has a global Dirichlet prior.\n",
