    "summary": "Quicksort is one of the most efficient general-purpose sorting algorithms. It works by choosing a \"pivot\" element from the array, dividing the array into those elements less than or larger than the pivot, and recursively sorting the subarrays. It exemplifies the divide-and-conquer approach to algorithm design and the benefits of randomness.\n",
