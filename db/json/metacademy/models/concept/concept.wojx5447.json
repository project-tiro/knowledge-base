    "summary": "While conjugate gradient is a method for solving linear systems (and important properties of the algorithm depend on this), it can also be applied heuristically to optimization problems more generally. The Fletcher-Reeves and Polak-Ribiere algorithms are two particular methods for doing so.\n",
