    "summary": "The framework of Bayesian model comparison evaluates probabilistic models based on the marginal likelihood, or the probability they assign a dataset with all the parameters marginalized out. The marginalization of model parameters implements a sort of \"Occam's razor\" effect. Marginal likelihoods can also be used to compute a posterior over model classes using Bayes' rule.\n",
