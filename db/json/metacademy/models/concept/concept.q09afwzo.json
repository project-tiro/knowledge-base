    "summary": "In pattern recognition and information retrieval, precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of retrieved instances that are relevant, while recall (also called sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved (Wikipedia). For instance, if there were 50 relevant documents in a corpus where 20 of the 50 documents were relevant to a user, and an information retrieval (IR) system returned 20 documents, where 6 of the documents were relevant, the recall would be 6/50 = 0.12, and the precision would be 6/20 = 0.3.\n",
