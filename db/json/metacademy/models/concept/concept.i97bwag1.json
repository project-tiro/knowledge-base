    "summary": "Given a vector field X on a manifold, an integral curve for X through p is a curve passing through p whose tangent vector matches X at every point. The set of all integral curves can be analyzed in terms of a flow, where each point is transported along the corresponding integral curve. Flows are used to define the Lie derivative.\n",
