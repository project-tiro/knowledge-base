    "pointers": "* Tikhonov regularization is one strategy for learning invariances in neural nets. Others include:\n** building it explicitly into the architecture, as in  [convolutional nets](convolutional_nets)\n**  [augmenting the training set](augmenting_training_set_warped)  with warped examples\n**  [tangent propagation](tangent_propagation) , which penalizes instability with respect to transformations\n*  [Denoising autoencoders](denoising_autoencoders)  are a neural net architecture based on the idea of invariance to noise in the inputs.",
