    "summary": "A map from one differentiable manifold to another is differentiable if the corresponding map between local coordinate charts is differentiable. This is independent of the particular coordinate charts. A bijective map which is differentiable in both directions is a diffeomorphism. Differential geometry primarily studies properties which are invariant under diffeomorphism.\n",
