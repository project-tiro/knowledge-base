    "summary": "Suppose you wish to find an object that satisfies certain constraints, such as a solution to a Sudoku puzzle. Recursive backtracking is an elegant way to implement a brute-force search. It uses recursive calls to build up a candidate solution, backtracking whenever it violates a constraint so that it can move on to the next possibility. ",
