    "summary": "The truncated Newton method (also called inexact Newton, or Newton-CG), is a quasi-Newton optimization method. It works by approximately solving the Newton system in each iteration using a small number of conjugate gradient steps. It is memory efficient, as it can be implemented with implicit Hessian-vector products without having to construct the full Hessian matrix.\n",
