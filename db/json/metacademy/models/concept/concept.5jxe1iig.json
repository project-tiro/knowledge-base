    "summary": "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), or Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), is a statistical technique typically used for analyzing relationships between a set of documents and the terms they contain. At its core, LSA performs singular value decomposition (SVD) on a term-by-document count matrix of a corpus and interprets the SVD factors as the \"topics\" of the documents.  We can then use these resulting factors (topics) to determine the document-document, document-term, and term-term similarities in the given corpus.\n",
