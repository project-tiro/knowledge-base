    "summary": "A topological sort is an ordering of the nodes in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) such that if there is an edge A -> B in the graph, then A comes before B in the ordering. This can be used to determine a sequence of jobs which respects a prerequisite graph. The learning plans in Metacademy are generated using a topological sort.\n",
