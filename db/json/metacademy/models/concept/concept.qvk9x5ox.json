    "summary": "Roughly, the laws of large numbers state that if a random variable is sampled many times, the average of all the values approaches the expectation. In particular, the weak law states that the probability of the average of n trials differing by more than some value epsilon goes to zero as n goes to infinity. Unlike the strong law, it only requires that the variables be uncorrelated, not necessarily independent.\n",
