Other ways include:\n**  [augmenting the training set with warped examples](augmenting_training_set_wapred)\n**  [tangent propagation](tangent_propagation) , which penalizes instability with respect to transformations\n**  [Tikhonov regularization](tikhonov_regularization) , which penalizes instability with respect to noise\n*  [Learning invariances](learning_invariances_in_neural_nets)  is a major goal in the field of representation learning.\n* Convolutional neural nets learn oriented filters similar to the  [receptive fields in the human primary visual cortex](representations_in_v1) .",

    "summary": "Convolutional neural networks are a kind of feed-forward neural net architecture geared towards visual processing. In each layer, there are several groups of units whose weights are repeated (or \"shared\") across all spatial locations. The forward pass and backpropagation updates can both be computed efficiently using convolution.\n \n",
