    "summary": "Arc consistency is a heuristic for pruning out possible values for the variables in a CSP which cannot possibly be part of a consistent solution. The set of values for all variables is arc consistent if for each value d of a variable X, and each neighbor Y of X, there is some value of Y which is consistent with d (in terms of the constraint between X and Y). The AC3 procedure iteratively removes values until the graph is arc consistent.\n",
