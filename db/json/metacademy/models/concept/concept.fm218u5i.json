    "summary": "Maximum likelihood is a general and powerful technique for learning statistical models, i.e. fitting the parameters to data. The maximum likelihood parameters are the ones under which the observed data has the highest probability. It is widely used in practice, and techniques such as Bayesian parameter estimation are closely related to maximum likelihood.\n",
