    "summary": "In some graphical models, it is intractable even to compute the messages in loopy belief propagation. Expectation propagation is a way of approximating these messages in terms of expectations of sufficient statistics. It can be viewed as a variational inference algorithm, and often gives much more accurate results than mean field based approximations.\n",
