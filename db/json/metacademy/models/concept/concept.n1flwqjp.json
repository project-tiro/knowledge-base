[Variational Bayes](variational_bayes)  gives a way of doing this.\n* An alternative to the evidence approximation is to define a prior over the hyperparameters and integrate them out. This is an instance of  [hierarchical Bayesian modeling](hierarchical_bayesian_modeling) .\n* The evidence approximation  [can be computed exactly](evidence_approximation_gaussian_processes)  in the case of Gaussian processes.",
