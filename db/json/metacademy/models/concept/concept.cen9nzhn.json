    "summary": "Trust region methods are a way of damping the updates in second-order optimization algorithms, based on the intuition that the curvature information is untrustworthy outside of a certain radius from the current point. They work by (perhaps approximately) minimizing the quadratic objective function subject to a norm constraint.\n",
