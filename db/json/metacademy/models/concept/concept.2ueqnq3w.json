    "summary": "Many mathematical objects, such as natural numbers, lists, and trees, are defined recursively in terms of basic components and composition rules. Structural induction is a technique for proving statements inductively about recursively defined structures. One proves base cases corresponding to the base objects, as well as inductive steps corresponding to each of the composition rules.\n",
