    "summary": "The cotangent bundle of a differentiable manifold M is the bundle of dual spaces to the tangent spaces at each point of M. The elements are known as covectors. An important example of a covector field is the differential of a function -- this is the generalization of the gradient to manifolds. Pullback is an operator which \"pulls back\" a covector field over a map.\n",
