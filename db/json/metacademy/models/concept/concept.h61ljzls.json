    "summary": "An abstract data type is a specification of the behavior of a data type (often a class) without reference to its underlying implementation. Data abstraction is one of the fundamental principles of software engineering, since it facilitates the decomposition of a problem into independent chunks and allows the implementation of the data type to change without breaking the client code.\n",
