    "summary": "Two vector fields X and Y on a manifold commute if their Lie bracket is zero. Equivalently, the flows for X and Y commute, i.e. can be applied in either order. A set of n linearly independent vector fields on an n-manifold can be expressed as coordinate derivatives in some coordinate chart if and only if they commute.\n",
