    "summary": "Logistic regression is a machine learning model for binary classification, i.e. learning to classify data points into one of two categories. It's a linear model, in that the decision depends only on the dot product of a weight vector with a feature vector. This means the classification boundary can be represented as a hyperplane. It's a widely used model in its own right, and the general structure of linear-followed-by-sigmoid is a common motif in neural networks.\n",
