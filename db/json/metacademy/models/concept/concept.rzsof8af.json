    "summary": "Fisher information is a quantity from statistics which measures the amount of information a sample from a distribution provides about the parameter value. It has several equivalent definitions, one of which is the variance of the derivative of the log-likelihood. Since it determines the asymptotic behavior of maximum likelihood estimation, it can be used to compute approximate confidence intervals for parameters.",
