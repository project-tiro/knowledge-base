    "summary": "The tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold is the collection of tangent spaces at all points of the manifold. There are several equivalent definitions of tangent vectors, the elements of tangent spaces: directional derivatives, vectors in coordinate charts, and equivalence classes of curves. Pushforward is an operation which carries tangent vectors over a map between manifolds.\n",
