[Belief propagation](gaussian_bp_on_trees)  gives a way of sharing these computations. \n*  [Kalman smoothing](kalman_as_bp)  can be seen as a special case of Gaussian BP.\n*  [Gaussian variable elimination](gaussian_variable_elimination_as_gaussian_elimination)  is equivalent to Gaussian elimination.",
