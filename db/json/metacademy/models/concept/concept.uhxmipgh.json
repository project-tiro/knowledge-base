    "summary": "Training deep feed-forward neural networks can be difficult because of local optima in the objective function and because complex models are prone to overfitting. Unsupervised pre-training initializes a discriminative neural net from one which was trained using an unsupervised criterion, such as a deep belief network or a deep autoencoder. This method can sometimes help with both the optimization and the overfitting issues.\n",
