    "summary": "Pushdown automata are a simple model of computation where the memory consists of an (unbounded) stack of symbols. Nondeterministic pushdown automata are equivalent in expressive power to context-free grammars. Deterministic pushdown automata can recognize only a smaller set of languages, but most modern programming languages are recognizable by a deterministic pushdown automaton.\n",
