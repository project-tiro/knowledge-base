    "summary": "Simulated annealing is a kind of hill-climbing search, often applied to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) or optimization problems. In order to escape local optima, it starts with a \"hotter\" version of the problem, where downhill moves are frequently taken. It gradually cools down the temperature, such that the behavior approaches standard hill-climbing. If the cooling down is done slowly enough, simulated annealing is guaranteed to find the global optimum.\n",
