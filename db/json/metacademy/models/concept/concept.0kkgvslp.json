    "pointers": "* Many  [computations on multivariate Gaussians](computations_on_multivariate_gaussians)  are more efficient in information form.\n* We saw we can represent multivariate Gaussians in covariance form or information form. These dual representations apply to  [exponential families](exponential_families)  more generally.\n*  [Gaussian Markov random fields](gaussian_mrfs)  are a kind of graphical model which captures sparsity in the information form representation.",

    "summary": "While we normally represent multivariate Gaussians in terms of their mean and covariance, information form is often a useful alternative. The distribution is represented in terms of a quadratic \"energy function.\" This representation is convenient for conditioning, and is the basis for Gaussian Markov random fields.\n",
