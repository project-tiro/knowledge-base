Common examples include polytrees and chordal graphs.\n* In such cases,  [factor graph belief propagation](factor_graph_bp)  can be applied to perform exact inference.",

    "summary": "Markov random fields often can't reflect the full conditional independence structure of a probabilistic model. For instance, they can't encode whether the variables in a clique have a fully general interaction, or merely pairwise interactions. Factor graphs are a more fine-grained representation of Boltzmann distributions where the factors are shown explicitly in the graph.\n",
