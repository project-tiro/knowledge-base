    "summary": "The spectral decomposition is the decomposition of a symmetric matrix A into QDQ^T, where Q is an orthogonal matrix and D is a diagonal matrix. The columns of Q correspond to the eigenvectors of A, and the diagonal entries of D correspond to the eigenvalues. This is possible because of a surprising fact about symmetric matrices: they have a full set of orthogonal eigenvectors. This decomposition gives a useful way to think about symmetric matrices: they are like diagonal matrices in a rotated coordinate system.\n",
