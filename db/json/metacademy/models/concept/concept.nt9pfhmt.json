    "summary": "Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers eventually converge to their stationary distribution, but they may take a long time to do so. The \"mixing time\" of a chain refers to how long a chain must be run in order for one sample to be independent of another. Diagnosing mixing time is important for judging the reliability of estimates obtained from an MCMC algorithm.\n",
