    "summary": "A vector is is a fundamental mathematical structure that is characterized by both a direction (ordering) and a magnitude. For instance, wind has both a direction (North, South-West, etc) and a magnitude (10 km/hour) and could be represented as a vector (10 km/hour South-West). A point in Euclidean space is often represented as a vector of its coordinates and is the most common type of vector encountered. More generally, a vector is an element of a vector space -- a set that is closed under scalar multiplication and vector addition. [additional note: a vector is a very general entity that takes on many forms depending on its context, for instance, in certain vector spaces a vector could be a function such as f(x) = sin(x)]  \n",
