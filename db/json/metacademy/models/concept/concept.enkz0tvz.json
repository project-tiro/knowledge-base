    "summary": "Conjugate gradient is an algorithm for solving large systems of linear equations of the form Ax = b where A is positive definite. It works by ensuring that the search directions are all conjugate (a property which generalizes the notion of orthogonality). Since it is implemented in terms of matrix-vector products, it is efficient when A is sparse, or when Ax can otherwise be computed efficiently.",
