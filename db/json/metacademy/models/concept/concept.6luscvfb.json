    "pointers": "*  [Poisson processes](poisson_process)  are a kind of stochastic process where counts of events within a set follow a Poisson distribution.\n* For large values of the scale parameter, the Poisson distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution. This follows from the  [Central Limit Theorem](central_limit_theorem) .\n* The Poisson distribution is a member of the  [exponential family](exponential_families) .",

    "summary": "The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution for the counts of independent random events in a given time interval, e.g. babies born in a hospital in 1 month or lightening strikes in Mexico in 1 week. It is one of the most common discrete distributions used in virtually every scientific and financial field.\n",
